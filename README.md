# Template code used for MCU (ATSAMV71Q21B)

This template **must** be used for every embedded programming development that will happen on AcubeSAT.
**contains MPLAB generated files** (Autogenerated.X), all the nessecery **FreeRTOS's files** (FreeRTOSConfig.h, FreeRTOS/) , modyfied **linker**, **cmakelists** file, **CU files*** (config/ , packs/) and a simple main.c file.

## Features :
- Harmony generated files
- FreeRTOS integration
- GCC compiler
- Clion IDE

## Things to be considered
- Some generated log files need to be deleted
- Brutally disabled Systick_Handler in plib_systick.c should be disabled by a setting in MPLAB X
- Currently only the PA23 (LED) pin is enabled
- There is an issue regarding merging existing MPLAB settings with new ones, it cannot reproduce the macros needed
- FreeRTOS's configurations are not finalized (static memory allocation etc)
- Restructure of file system may be considered (inc/, src/, lib/)
- ETL and Catch2 missing
